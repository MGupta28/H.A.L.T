# H.A.L.T
## Holistic Traffic Management System

The project had multiple (Proximity sensors embedded on the road to determine the density of traffic waiting on a particular signal and accordingly control the traffic lights. Apart from this the red-light sensors also had a RFID receiver which detected a passing emergency vehicle such as an ambulance and appropriately changed the traffic lights.In addition to this grafana was used to represent data in a dynamic way.

### Problem
***

- Need for an effective way to manage traffic efficiently.
- To help increase the efficiency of Emergency Services.

### Proposed Solution
***

- IoT based Traffic Management System
- We have aimed at adding multiple sensors embedded on the road to determine the
  density of traffic waiting on a particular signal and accordingly control the traffic lights.
- Apart from this the red-light sensors also
has a receiver which detects a passing
emergency vehicle such as an ambulance
and get changed appropriately.

### Tech Stacks used
***

This is an IoT enabled Traffic Management System. In this project we have used multiple Tech. stacks like:

- Django
- Grafana
- Fusion 360
- Prometheus
- C++
- Python
- Arduino IDE
- 
Furthermore we have used:

- RFID Sensor
- Servo
- IR sensor
- LCD

We even used Open cv for better detection of traffic.

### Data Visualisation using GRAFANA
***

Grafana is a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application. It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources.

We are using it to show the data coming in from the sensors to monitor the flow of traffic in a better and visually appealing way.

### Future Aspects 
***

- Implementation of OpenCV.
- The solution is proposed to reduce the initial
implementation and setup cost of the hardware
replacing costly sensors with the pre-installed cctv
cameras at the junction.
